Maple Software Basics

**Maple is a mathematical software that allows users to perform symbolic and numeric computations, including algebraic manipulation, calculus, and equation solving. It is widely used in academic, scientific, and engineering fields for its versatility in mathematical modeling and analysis.**

## Basic Commands

`:=` is used for assignment of value or expression to a variable.
For example: 
```maple
variable_name := expression;
```
Also you could use `Esc` button for command **competion**, this is a lot easier, and also if you make a command, but it didn't work well, you could try again, just when you finished writing command, use `Esc` to complete the command.

### Matrix

To make a matrix, you could do this using a command

```maple
A := Matrix([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]) # Assigning Matrix into A variable
```
#### Find Determinant

```maple
LinearAlgebra[Determinant](A)
```

### Function

#### Differentiate

At the begining you could specify a function, and then use `diff` command like diff(expression,variable). For example:

```maple
y := (2x-4)^5 # Specifying a function
diff(y,x) # Differentiating the function
```
